# API Reference Overview

The WP Engine Customer API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing your WordPress sites, accounts, and users. This reference documentation will help you understand the available resources and how to interact with them.

## Base URL & Versioning

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1
```

The current version of the API is `v1`. The version is included in the URL path to ensure compatibility as the API evolves.

## Authentication

The API uses Basic Authentication. You'll need your API username and password from the [WP Engine User Portal](https://my.wpengine.com/api_access). See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication/) for detailed instructions.

## Making Requests

### Content Types

The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies:
- For JSON requests: `Content-Type: application/json`

### HTTP Methods

The API uses standard HTTP methods:

- `GET`: Retrieve resources
- `POST`: Create new resources
- `PATCH`: Update existing resources
- `DELETE`: Remove resources

Here's an example of each method:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="GET">
    ```bash
    # Retrieve a site
    curl -X GET "https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/sites/28c78b6d-c2da-4f09-85f5-1ad588089b2d" \
      -u "API_USER_ID:API_USER_PASSWORD"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="POST">
    ```bash
    # Create a new site
    curl -X POST "https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/sites" \
      -u "API_USER_ID:API_USER_PASSWORD" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "Torque Magazine",
        "account_id": "eeda3227-9a39-46ae-9e14-20958bb4e6c9"
      }'
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PATCH">
    ```bash
    # Update a site's name
    curl -X PATCH "https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/sites/28c78b6d-c2da-4f09-85f5-1ad588089b2d" \
      -u "API_USER_ID:API_USER_PASSWORD" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "My New Name"
      }'
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="DELETE">
    ```bash
    # Delete a site
    curl -X DELETE "https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/sites/28c78b6d-c2da-4f09-85f5-1ad588089b2d" \
      -u "API_USER_ID:API_USER_PASSWORD"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200 | Success - The request was successful |
| 201 | Created - The resource was successfully created |
| 204 | No Content - The request was successful (often for DELETE operations) |
| 400 | Bad Request - The request was invalid |
| 401 | Authentication Error - Invalid credentials |
| 403 | Not Authorized - You don't have permission |
| 404 | Not Found - The resource doesn't exist |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 503 | Service Unavailable - The service is temporarily unavailable |

## Response Format

Most endpoints return data in this format:

```json
{
  "id": "28c78b6d-c2da-4f09-85f5-1ad588089b2d",
  "name": "Torque Magazine",
  "account": {
    "id": "eeda3227-9a39-46ae-9e14-20958bb4e6c9"
  }
}
```

List endpoints return paginated results:

```json
{
  "previous": "https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/sites?limit=100&offset=0",
  "next": "https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/sites?limit=100&offset=200",
  "count": 225,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "28c78b6d-c2da-4f09-85f5-1ad588089b2d",
      "name": "Torque Magazine",
      "account": {
        "id": "eeda3227-9a39-46ae-9e14-20958bb4e6c9"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

See the [Pagination guide](/api-reference/pagination/) for details on working with paginated responses.

## Error Responses

When an error occurs, the API returns an error object:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Authentication Error">
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Bad Credentials"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bad Request">
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Invalid Site: Name cannot be empty."
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Not Found">
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Not Found"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Rate Limited">
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Domain status checks are rate-limited to one request every 5 seconds for each install"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Testing the API

You can test if the API is working by making a request to the status endpoint:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/status"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PHP">
    ```php
    $client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
    $response = $client->get('https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/status');
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/status')
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    const axios = require('axios');
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.wpengineapi.com/v1/status');
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

A successful response looks like:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created_on": "2023-05-17T16:20:40+00:00"
}
```
