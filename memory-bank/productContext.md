- User understands rate limiting and best practices
- User can troubleshoot common issues independently

### Long-term (Ongoing Use)
- Documentation serves as reliable reference for all API operations
- User contributes feedback that improves documentation quality
- User recommends WP Engine API based on documentation experience

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Time to First API Call**: < 15 minutes from documentation entry
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of API endpoints documented
- **Example Accuracy**: 0 broken code examples in production
- **Update Latency**: < 24 hours from API change to doc update
- **User Satisfaction**: > 4.5/5 rating on documentation quality
